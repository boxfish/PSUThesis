\chapter{Designing for Awareness Support} % (fold)
\label{cha:designing_for_awareness_support}
Following the conceptual model of awareness phenomena in complex collaborative activities, we describe the design space of awareness support in this chapter. The goal of this chapter is to identify key design issues to support awareness in distributed, complex collaborative activities, by mapping them to the major components in our conceptual model presented in \ref{cha:understanding_awareness}. Then we discuss how these design issues have been addressed (partially) in existing awareness support systems, and what they inform for our approach. 

\section{The Design Space} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_design_space}

Individual Awareness Processes: as cognitive artifacts (\cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF02032391})
 - Perception
  - support representation: representing state of the world, representing the change
  - support process: make the info perceivable, easy to perceive, less effort

 - Comprehension
  - support representation: representing existing knowledge, context
  - support process: interaction, make the analysis easier 	

 - Projection
  - support representation: represent the result of interpretation, context
  - support link to long-term knowledge, 

 - Decision Making
  - 
  
 - Action Execution: not necessary through the awareness system, more important is to provide the representation to guide the execution.


Team Awareness Processes
 - Feed-through
 - Displaying/Monitoring
 - Communication

\section{The State of Art} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_state_of_art}

Event notification model (GroupDesk, PoLIAwaC et al.)
Spatial model
Focus/Nimbus Model
Diffusion
Atmosphere

Dimensions
Field of Work: activity, local scope, dependencies
Processes: perception, interpretation, decision-making, action, propagation
Interplay: 
whether the filed of work can be updated by the processes
whether the processes are supported by explicit representation of field of work
