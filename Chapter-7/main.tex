\chapter{Architecture and Implementation} % (fold)
\label{cha:system_implementation}
To validate our computational approach, a prototype system EDAP (Event-driven awareness promotion) is implemented in this study. The EDAP server provides a generic event-driven infrastructure for awareness promotion that can be applied in different application domain. EDAP client is a standalone Web-based interactive awareness system that is used to demonstrate the functionality of our approach. In this chapter, we first describe the architecture of the system. Then we describe the implementation details of the server and the client.

\section{Architecture of EDAP} % (fold)
\label{sec:architecture_of_edap}
EDAP follows a typical client/server architecture model (Figure \ref{fig:edap_architecture}). The EDAP server provides the major functions of the event-driven awareness promotion, i.e. it maintains the knowledge representation, performs the knowledge updating and event processing. The EDAP client provides the visual and interactive environment that allows the user to perceive and interpret events,  generate new events, and manage subscriptions and visibility policies.

	\caption{Architecture of EDAP}
	\label{fig:edap_architecture}
\end{figure}

The interaction between the client and server follows the service-oriented network protocols. The REST protocol \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational\_state\_transfer} is used to implement the request/response communication style, i.e. clients initiate requests to servers and servers process requests and return appropriate responses. The COMET protocol \footnote{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet\_(programming)} is used to offer the push notification from the server to the client by maintaining a long-held HTTP request between them. 
The EDAP client provides several components that can interact with the server. The \emph{Event Generator} is used to create new events in the externalization process, and post the new events to the server for processing. The \emph{Visualization Manager} requests visualization specifications about the event view, activity view, and context view from the server, and render them in the client's interface. The \emph{Subscription Manager} requests the existing subscriptions from the server, provides the interface for the user to manage them or create new ones, and then send the modifications back to the server. The \emph{Visibility Manager} provides the similar function as the \emph{Subscription Manager} to manage visibility policies. The \emph{Event Notifier} establishes a long-polling connection with the server. Whenever a new event notification is sent from the server, it applies the corresponding notification style to notify the user. 

To respond to client requests, the EDAP server provides several components in the form of web services to handle the different types of requests. The \emph{Event Publishing Service} responds to the new events posted from the client or other event sources, stores them in the event repository, and notifies the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} to process them. The \emph{Visualization Service} generates the visualization specifications for the event view and activity view based on the knowledge from PlanGraph model and event repository. The \emph{Event Subscription Service} responds to the \emph{Subscription Manager} and updates the subscription repository. The \emph{Visibility Control Service} responds to the \emph{Visibility Manager} and updates the visibility policy repository. The \emph{Event Notification Service} responds to the message passed from the \emph{Notification Module} whenever a new event notification is generated, and push it to the corresponding clients. Besides these service-oriented modules, the server also includes two important processing modules: the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} perform the knowledge updating as described in Section \ref{sec:knowledge_updating_process} whenever new events are received; and the \emph{Notification Module} provides the local scope-based event notification mechanism (Section \ref{sec:event_notification_mechanism}) to distribute events. 

The communication between modules in the EDAP server is achieved through a limited form of the publish/subscribe interaction. Each module can publish important messages during its performance, and the other modules that need to respond to these messages need to subscribe to them. In this way, the interaction between modules can be asynchronous so that they do not block each other while waiting for others to finish their task. In addition, it provides a distributed interaction style that allows the different modules to be deployed across multiple machines.

\section{Implementation of EDAP server} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation_of_edap_server}
The functional modules EDAP server is implemented using the Python programing language, and the web services are developed in the Django \footnote{http://djangoproject.com} framework. The three data repositories, i.e. event, subscription and visibility repositories, as well as the knowledge base, are implemented as PostgreSQl \footnote{http://www.postgresql.org} databases. In the following, we describe the implementation details on major modules and the repositories are discussed within the respective modules that can manipulate them. 

\subsection{Service-oriented modules} % (fold)
\label{sub:service_oriented_modules}
The EDAP server includes five service-oriented modules to handle the different types of client requests. 

\paragraph*{Event Publishing Service} % (fold)
\label{par:event_publishing_service}
The \emph{Event Publishing Service} is the first responder to the new events that are published to the system, and its major responsibility is to store the events in the event repository. There are two types of event sources where the \emph{Event Publishing Service} can receive events:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Events can come externally from the different types of clients as HTTP requests, including the EDAP client or other event sensors or simulators. For these events, after storing them in the repository, the service also needs to send out a \emph{`NewEvent'} message notifying the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} to perform knowledge updating on the new event.
	\item They can also come from the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} as it generates new derived or anticipatory events. These events are published by the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} as \emph{`UpdatedEvent'} messages, and the \emph{Event Publishing Service} needs to subscribe to them and store them in the repository. 
\end{enumerate}

The events received by the \emph{Event Publishing Service} are described as attribute-value tuples, and the service needs to store these events in the event repository. The event repository needs to be semi-structured as the different event types supported by the system can have different set of attributes. However, this cannot be directly achieved in a relational database like PostgreSQl. As a result, we only store the header of each event directly in the data tables, but add two additional long text field (\emph{payload} and \emph{opencontent}) for each record. These two fields store the XML formatted tuples corresponding to the attributes in the event's payload and open content. Besides the event table that stores all the events, the event repository also includes a relation table to record the event chains or event propagation trees. Whenever an event is added to the repository, a new record is added to the event development table as well with the id of parent event (null for original events) and the current event, along with the label indicating the type of the event. Figure \ref{fig:event_repository} shows the data tables in the event repository. 

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics{event_repository.pdf} 
	\caption{Data tables in the event repository}
	\label{fig:event_repository}
\end{figure}
% paragraph event_publishing_service (end)

\paragraph*{Visualization Service} % (fold)
\label{par:visualization_service}
The \emph{Visualization Service} responds to the client's request for visualizing the event view or activity view. The service retrieves the necessary data from event repository or PlanGraph model, uses it to generate a visualization specification in the JSON format and sends it back to the client. 

For the request to visualize the event view given the current event under interpretation, the service searches the event repository recursively to find all the events that are included in the event propagation tree, and generates a JSON object to represent the tree structure.

In order to generate the visualization specification for the activity view, the service maintains the most recent version of the local scopes and dependency network constructed from the PlanGraph model. The \emph{Visualization Service} subscribes to the message \emph{`updatedPlanGraph'} that is published by the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} each time the PlanGraph model is changed. Hence, whenever the \emph{Visualization Service} receives such message, it uses the PlanGraph model to reconstruct the local scopes and dependency network so that it always keeps the newest version. Whenever the client requests an activity view given a specific user, the user's local scope is first retrieved, and the entities in the local scope are added to the visualization specification. Then the entities in the local scope are searched in the dependency network recursively to find all the other entities that have dependency relations with them, and these entities outside the local scope are added to visualization specification.
% paragraph visualization_service (end)

\paragraph*{Event Subscription Service} % (fold)
\label{par:event_subscription_service}
The \emph{Event Subscription Service} responds to the client's request to list all the current subscriptions, add a new subscription, modify or delete an existing subscription. The existing subscription of each user is stored in the subscription repository. If the request is to add a new subscription, a new record will be added into the repository. If the request is to modify or delete an existing one, the subscription id will be used to identify the record in the repository and perform the update or delete operation. 

Because the event pattern in each subscription is semi-structured with multiple filter expressions, we also use the XML formatted text field to store the filters for each subscription. Figure \ref{fig:sub_repository} shows the subscription table with an example of the XML formatted event pattern that include all the three types of filter expressions discussed in Section \ref{sub:managing_subscriptions}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics{sub_repository.pdf} 
	\caption{An example subscription record}
	\label{fig:sub_repository}
\end{figure}
% paragraph event_subscription_service (end)

\paragraph*{Visibility Control Service} % (fold)
\label{par:visibility_control_service}
The \emph{Visibility Control Service} works in the similar way as the \emph{Event Subscription Service}, to manipulate the visibility repository to retrieve, add, modify or delete visibility policies. Unlike the subscriptions, each visibility policy has three semi-structured fields: the \emph{eventPattern} is similar to the event pattern in subscriptions, the \emph{receiverPattern} includes the filter expressions that are used to define the receivers to whom the event is visible, and \emph{attributeList} is the list of visible attributes. Figure \ref{fig:vis_repository} shows an example of a record in the visibility repository.
\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics{vis_repository.pdf} 
	\caption{An example visibility policy record}
	\label{fig:vis_repository}
\end{figure}
% paragraph visibility_control_service (end)

\paragraph*{Event Notification Service} % (fold)
\label{par:event_notification_service}
The \emph{Event Notification Service} maintains a long polling connection with each client so that it can push new event notifications to the client. The service stores a routing table that maps each user id to the corresponding client connection. The service subscribes to the message \emph{`newEventNotification'} that is published by the \emph{Notification Module} each time a new event notification is generated. Whenever the \emph{Event Notification Service} receives such a message, it searches the routing table to find a match between the receiver of the notification and the client connection. If a connection is found, the service pushes the event notification to the corresponding user via the client connection.

% subsection service_oriented_modules (end)

\subsection{The Knowledge updating module} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_knowledge_updating_module}
The \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} performs the knowledge updating process as we described in Section \ref{sec:knowledge_updating_process}. As the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} manipulates the PlanGraph model, we first describe how the PlanGraph model is implemented, then discuss the implementation of the knowledge updating process.

\paragraph*{Implementation of the PlanGraph} % (fold)
\label{par:implementation_of_the_plangraph}
The PlanGraph is implemented in the object-oriented paradigm as a dynamic data structure by several data objects. The overall \emph{PlanGraph} object points to the root plan node. Each \emph{PlanNode} objects includes attributes recording the parent node and the subsidiary plan nodes, which together allows the recursive traverse throughout the PlanGraph hierarchy. 

The \emph{PlanNode} has three types of subsidiary classes, corresponding to the three types of nodes in the PlanGraph model.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Each \emph{ActionNode} defines the properties of an action, such as the type of the action, whether it is a basic or complex action, the execution state, the current recipe of the action. Each \emph{ActionNode} also includes two slots to store the actors' intentions and capabilities towards the action. Besides, each \emph{ActionNode} includes a list of parameters and the conditions.
	\item Each \emph{ParamNode} object represents a parameter that includes the type of the parameter, the execution state, the values, and the list of conditions about the parameter.
	\item Each \emph{CondNode} object represents a condition that includes the type of the parameter, the execution state, and an expression indicating the content of the condition.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page

	\includegraphics{pg_class_diagram.pdf} 
	\caption{The class diagram of the PlanGraph}
	\label{fig:pg_class_diagram}
\end{figure}
% paragraph implementation_of_the_plangraph (end)

\paragraph*{Implementation of the knowledge updating process} % (fold)
\label{par:implementation_of_the_knowledge_updating_process}
The \emph{Knowledge Updating Module} includes four subsidiary modules, complying with the four steps of the knowledge updating process. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \emph{Association} sub-module establishes the association between the input event and the current PlanGraph mode by searching all the nodes in the PlanGraph. It starts with the recognition of event type for each input event, as the different event types are treated differently. The association is implemented as a native function in Python that follows the search strategies we discussed in Section \ref{sub:association}. Once an association is found, it updates the value of the corresponding node in the PlanGraph, and then add the pointer to the node into the event object.
	\item \emph{Assessment} sub-module evaluates each event check how it can lead to changes towards the action performance, such as the execution state change of an action, or a condition. This sub-module is achieved by defining a set of assessment rules and employing a knowledge engine Pyke \footnote{http://pyke.sourceforge.net} to enable the forward chaining inference. The knowledge engine uses the PlanGraph to assess all the possible changes due to the new information stored in the event, and then generate new events to represent these changes. Whenever a new event is generated in this step, the module publishes a new \emph{`NewEvent'} message, so that the other modules that subscribe to it can get notified.
	\item \emph{Elaboration} sub-module advances the collaborative activity from the system side based on the change from the new event. The elaboration is achieved with the support of two types of knowledge stored in the knowledge base: (1) the recipe knowledge about how to derive an action into a sequence of parameters, pre-conditions, and subsidiary actions, how to identify a unbound parameter, or how to satisfy a condition, etc.; (2) the knowledge about actor roles and the potential intentions and capabilities towards actions. These two types of knowledge are stored in the \emph{knowledge base} in the form of a PostgreSQl database. The content of each recipe is stored in an XML formatted text field along with other general information about the recipe. The actor role specifications are stored in a data table mapping each role to the potential intended action type, or the actions that the actors in the role are capable of performing.
	\item \emph{Propagation} sub-module is a standard Bayesian network-based reasoning process. This module first constructs the dependency network from the PlanGraph model following the algorithm described in Section \ref{sub:representing_dependencies}. Then we employ the open source Python library, OpenBayes, to propagate the state change in the dependency network. Based on the results of the propagation, we generate new events to represent these changes, and new \emph{`NewEvent'} messages will be published to notify other modules.
\end{enumerate}

After the four steps have been performed, the knowledge updating module publishes two new messages \emph{`UpdatedEvent'} and \emph{`UpdatedPlanGraph'}. The former is used by the \emph{Notification Module} to start generating event notifications, and the latter notifies the \emph{Visualization Service} to reconstruct the local scopes and dependency network.
% paragraph implementation_of_the_knowledge_updating_process (end)
% subsection the_knowledge_updating_module (end)

\subsection{The Notification module} % (fold)
\label{sub:the_notification_module}
The \emph{Notification Module} performs the event notification algorithms to generate event notifications after the knowledge updating process is done on each event, i.e. whenever it receives a new message \emph{`UpdatedEvent'} from the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module}. The \emph{Notification Module} generates event notifications in three steps, and different type of knowledge is used in each step.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The PlanGraph is used in the first step to perform the local scope-based filtering as described in Section \ref{sub:event_filtering_algorithm}. The module implements the $FILTER\textrm{-}LS$ algorithm as a standard Python function and execute it on each user participated in the PlanGraph. If the function returns true, the second step is performed.
	\item During the second step, the user's subscriptions are retrieved from the subscription repository, and the event is evaluated against each of the subscriptions. If the event matches the event pattern of a subscription, the third step is performed.
	\item In this step, the user's visibility policies are retrieved from the visibility repository, and the $APPLY\textrm{-}VIS$ algorithm (Section \ref{sub:controlling_visibility}) is implemented to apply the visibility policies to the event notification. If function returns true, i.e. the event is visible to the actor, then the corresponding event notification is generated.
\end{enumerate}

Once an event notification is generated, the \emph{Notification Module} publishes a new messages \emph{`NewEventNotification'}, which is subscribed by the \emph{Event Notification Service} who will push the event notification to the user's client.

\section{Implementation of EDAP client} % (fold)
\label{sec:implementation_of_edap_client}
The EDAP client is a Web-based client provides the user with the lightweight HTML + JavaScript user interface to the awareness system. The EDAP client is implemented by using several Open Source JavaScript libraries: JQuery \footnote{http://jquery.com} framework for the interface layout, the OpenLayers \footnote{http://openlayers.org} mapping library to provide the geographic context view, and the d3 \footnote{http://d3js.org} library to generate the event view and activity view. The thin client design allows the user to easily access the system without installing any software or plug-ins. 

To demonstrate the functionalities of the EDAP client, we discuss a concrete use case in the motivating scenario of emergency response. A more detailed description of the scenario will be given in the case study (Section \ref{sec:an_emergency_response_scenario}). In this concrete use case, we consider the user as the victim manager ($VM$) who is in charge of managing all the victims that need to be rescued. In the normal workflow, $VM$ needs to monitor the status of all the victims. Whenever a new victim is reported by the first responders, $VM$ needs to evaluate the status and decide on whether the victim needs to be decontaminated or treated. For the current victims, $VM$ also needs to make sure the operations on them can be conducted in a timely way. Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_initial} shows the main interface for $VM$ during the normal workflow. The interface includes several views to support $VM$'s work. 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The \emph{victims} view on the left consists of a set of interactive data visualization tools to explore the victims. For $VM$, the interface allows him/her to monitor the status of every victim that has been reported. A dynamic query interface is used for filtering the victims based on attributes, time, and geographical locations.
	\item The \emph{victim detail} view shows the detailed information for a selected victim. We provide several context views for the $VM$ to evaluate each victim's information, including the text-based information about the victim, a spatio-temporal trajectory showing the movement of the victim, and a status transition view showing the history of the status change on the victim.
	\item The \emph{activity} view shows the current activity structure of the rescue action related to the victim, where $VM$ can interpret the events and externalize the interpretations through direct manipulation.
	\item The \emph{events list} view provides a list of current events notified to $VM$. $VM$ can click on each event to activate the event view to show more detail about the event.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5.8in]{vm_interface_initial_marked.jpg} 
	\caption{The main interface of EDAP for the victim manager \newline (1)\emph{victims} view, (2)\emph{victim detail} view, (3)\emph{activity} view, (4)\emph{events list} view}
	\label{fig:vm_interface_initial}
\end{figure}

Within this use case, we consider the awareness process that is conducted by $VM$ upon receiving an event and discuss the different functionalities provided by the EDAP client to support it. 

\paragraph*{Event notification} % (fold)
\label{par:event_notification}
The awareness process starts with $VM$ receiving an event notification in the interface. The event $E4$ indicates that the decontamination action on a victim ($Victim\textrm{-}16$) is delayed. Because the decontamination action is within $VM$'s local scope of work, the EDAP server generates an event notification and pushes the notification to $VM$. As the \emph{Event Notifier} module of the EDAP client receives the notification, it render the notification in the client based on the associated notification style that is defined by $VM$ in the subscriptions. In EDAP client, we support three notification styles with different obtrusiveness levels. At the most obtrusive level, we use an \emph{alert} that is a modal dialog on the interface, blocking everything in the client. The user has to confirm the reception of the notification before resuming the previous state. Then it could be a \emph{banner} that presents each incoming event notification at a dedicated corner for a period of time and then disappears. At the least obtrusive level, it can be a \emph{badge} that displays the total number of events attached with each victim in the victim list. The user can click the badge to open the event list to review the event notifications. The three notification styles correspond to the importance levels when the user manages subscriptions. The events with high importance level will be presented as alerts. Medium importance level corresponds to banners, and low importance level maps to badges. Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_notifications} shows an example of the three notification styles, and $E4$ in this case is presented to $VM$ as an \emph{alert}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{vm_interface_notifications_marked.jpg} 
	\caption{Event notification styles in EDAP client}
	\label{fig:vm_interface_notifications}
\end{figure}
% paragraph event_notification (end)

\paragraph*{Event interpretation} % (fold)
\label{par:event_interpretation}
Upon receiving the notification in the interface, $VM$ can click on the confirmation button in the alert to bring up the event view to perceive more detail about the event. The event view follows the general design principles described in Section \ref{sub:event_view}. The event $E4$ has been attached with an event propagation tree as it has been developed by several other actors. Hence, the client visualizes the event propagation tree along with the event, so that $DM$ can navigate through event propagation tree to understand the developmental history of the event. 

Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_event} shows the active event propagation chain attached with $E4$, which clearly shows the actors that are involved in developing $E4$. $DM$ can switch to the event propagation tree view by clicking the button at the toolbar. With in the event chain, $VM$ can mouse over each node to see detailed information about the event, such as the event type, occurrence time, payroll attributes, the actor who creates the event, and the author's free text notes. When clicking on the event node, the activity view will be adjusted so that the action/resource node associated with the event will be centered and highlighted. By browsing through the event propagation chain, $VM$ understands that the delay of the decontamination action is because of the delay of the transportation action to send the victim to the decontamination station, which is furthered caused by the mechanical problem with the driver's vehicle. In this way, $VM$ can back track to understand the origin of the event.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.6in]{vm_interface_event.jpg} 
	\caption{Event view in EDAP client}
	\label{fig:vm_interface_event}
\end{figure}

After understanding the event with the context of origin, $VM$ also evaluates how the event will impact her other actions in the projection process. This is supported by the activity view that is linked with the event view. The activity view provides the activity-related inferential frame for the $VM$ to predict the impacts of the event. Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_externalization} shows the activity view for $VM$, which allows $VM$ to navigate through the different entities in the activity structure, check the detail on each entity, and recognize different relations between them. The activity view treats the entities inside and outside $VM$'s local scope differently so that the user always know what part of the collaborative activity he/she needs to focus on, and it also allows the client to provide more detail information for the entities within the local scope. By navigating through the activity view, $VM$ infers that because of the delay of the decontamination action, the rescue action that depends on it will also be delayed. 
% paragraph event_interpretation (end)

\paragraph*{Event externalization} % (fold)
\label{par:event_externalization}
The result of $VM$'s interpretation leads to the further development of the event, as $VM$ believes that the rescue action will be delayed due to the dependency between decontamination and rescue action. To externalize this belief about the execution state change on the rescue action, $VM$ can click on the node in the activity view representing the rescue action and choose the option to change the execution state. The client shows up an pop-up window that allows the $VM$ to externalize the results of her interpretation, which is directly associated with the rescue action. Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_externalization} shows the externalization interface where $VM$ can select the expected state for the action, and provides the confidence level and explanation on the interpretation. Whenever $VM$ presses the `Change State' button, a new internal event representing the $VM$'s belief about the execution state on the rescue action will be sent to the server, with reference to the event under interpretation ($E4$).

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.3in]{vm_interface_externalization.jpg} 
	\caption{Event externalization in the activity view}
	\label{fig:vm_interface_externalization}
\end{figure}
% paragraph event_externalization (end)

\paragraph*{Event subscription/visibility} % (fold)
\label{par:event_subscription}
Besides the support for event notification, interpretation, and externalization, the EDAP client also provides two supplementary interfaces to support the management of subscriptions and visibilities. The interface to control event visibility is very similar to the event subscription interface, as a result we focus on the event subscription in the following.

Figure \ref{fig:vm_interface_subscription} shows $VM$'s interface to manage subscriptions. On the left is the visualization of the dependency networks along with the different actors' local scopes color-coded. The visualization is presented to the user gradually. In the beginning, only the entities within $VM$'s local scope of work is visible, so that $VM$ can focus on manage the subscriptions with in the local scope. Whenever $VM$ clicks on a node that has dependency relation with other entities outside the local scope, the dependency network is expanded to show the related entities as well, and $VM$ can subscribe to events associated with these entities as well. The expansion of the dependency network can be performed iteratively as $VM$ browses through the entities in a chain of dependencies. In this way, the system provides the initial control to limit subscriptions within the local scope, but at the same time allows the user to override the limitation and subscribe to events that are outside the local scope of work.

\begin{figure}[htbp] %  figure placement: here, top, bottom, or page
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=5.8in]{vm_interface_subscription.jpg} 
	\caption{Event subscription in EDAP client}
	\label{fig:vm_interface_subscription}
\end{figure}

To make a particular subscription, $VM$ clicks on a node in the dependency network, and all the visible events on the node is listed on the right of the interface. $VM$ can subscribe to any of the visible events directly or add extra filters on refine the subscriptions. In the EDAP client, we support all the three types of filters we discussed in Section \ref{sub:event_filtering_algorithm}, i.e. filters based on event type, content, and local scope. Besides the filters, $VM$ can also assign an important level to the subscription, which will be used to determine the notification styles as we mentioned in the event notification step.

\section{Discussion} % (fold)
\label{sec:discussion}
A prototype system EDAP (Event-driven awareness promotion) is implemented in this study to demonstrate the feasibility of our computational awareness promotion framework. The EDAP platform includes two components: (1) the EDAP server provides a generic event-driven infrastructure for awareness promotion that can be applied in different application domain. (2) the EDAP client is a standalone Web-based interactive awareness system that is used to demonstrate the functionalities of our approach.

The EDAP server has a modular architecture. Its core module, the \emph{Knowledge Updating Module}, incorporates the PlanGraph model to maintain dynamic knowledge about the collaborative activities and perform automatic reasoning to interpret the events. The implementation of the PlanGraph model and the various reasoning algorithms for knowledge construction and updating shows the feasibility of the knowledge representation and updating component in our approach as we proposed in Chapter \ref{cha:knowledge_reprsentation_and_updating}. The implementation of the EDAP server also provides us the computational platform to test the validity of the knowledge representation and updating algorithms. We describe such an effort through a simulation experiment in the case study (Section \ref{sec:simulating_the_knowledge_updating}).

The EDAP client demonstrates the functionalities of the approach in supporting different awareness processes. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The client supports the event notifications based on the local scopes, and manages  multiple notification styles in event subscriptions.
	\item It supports the backward tracking to understand the origin of an event by visualizing the event propagation tree in the event view.
	\item It supports the forward tracking to evaluate the potential impact of an event by providing an adaptive visualization of the collaborative activity. The visualization in adaptive in the sense that it provides more detail for the entities within the actor's local scope of work and is dynamically changed as the model of the collaborative activity is changed.
	\item It allows the users to directly externalize their interpretations in the activity view, which provides an efficient way to create new events that are associated with internal aspects of the actions and linked to other events in the developmental trajectory.
	\item Lastly, it provides the functionalities to manage event subscriptions and visibilities, which allows the users to retain controls in the awareness processes and customize the computer system's behaviors.
\end{enumerate}
