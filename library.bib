abstract = {The concept of distributed situation awareness (DSA) is currently receiving increasing attention from the human factors community. This article investigates DSA in a collaborative real-world industrial setting by discussing the results derived from a recent naturalistic study undertaken within the UK energy distribution domain. The results describe the DSA-related information used by the networks of agents involved in the scenarios analysed, the sharing of this information between the agents and the salience of different information elements used. Thus, the structure, quality and content of each network's DSA is discussed, along with the implications for DSA theory. The findings reinforce the notion that when viewing situation awareness (SA) in collaborative systems, it is useful to focus on the coordinated behaviour of the system itself, rather than on the individual as the unit of analysis and suggest that the findings from such assessments can potentially be used to inform system, procedure and training design. SA is a critical commodity for teams working in industrial systems and systems, procedures and training programmes should be designed to facilitate efficient system SA acquisition and maintenance. This article presents approaches for describing and understanding SA during real-world collaborative tasks, the outputs from which can potentially be used to inform system, training programmes and procedure design.},

In multi-agent systems (MAS) as a computational organization, agents are modeled and implemented separately from the environmental model. We follow this perspective and submit an architecture in which the environment is modeled as a discrete- event simulation, and the crisis response agents are modeled as a multi-agent system. The simultaneous integration and separation of both models allows for independent modifications of the response organization and the scenario, resulting in a testbed that allows testing different organizations to respond to the same scenario or different emergencies for the same organization. It also provides a high-level architecture suggesting the way in which DES and MAS can be combined into a single simulation in a simple way.},

abstract = {In many dynamic work situations, no single individual can acquire the varied and often rapidly expanding information needed for success. Individuals must work together to collect, analyze, synthesize and disseminate information throughout the work process. Perhaps one of the most dynamic work contexts is command and control in the military at the battalion level which directs 300 to 1000 soldiers on the battlefield. This paper reports on a study that explores human information behavior in command and control (C2). Data was gathered from simulated battle exercises, interviews with experienced C2 personnel and documentation on C2. During data analysis, three important themes that highlight the why, what, how and consequences of information behavior in C2 emerged. The first is the concept of interwoven situational awareness consisting of individual, intragroup and intergroup shared understanding of the situation. Interwoven situational awareness appears to facilitate response to dynamic, constraint-bound situations. The second theme describes the need for dense social networks or frequent communication between participants about the work context and situation, the work process and domain-specific information. The third theme is called ‘contested collaboration’, a phenomenon where team members maintain an outward stance of cooperation but work to further their own interests, at times sabotaging the collaborative effort. These results provide insights to the complex nature of human information behavior in dynamic and complex work contexts and lead to recommendations for training and further research.},

As the application domain scales up, maintaining integration across different kinds of views becomes more challenging. This paper presents the results of a study of three different approaches to integration based on the spatial and temporal proximity of related information objects. The domain used for evaluation was a simulation of an industry-scale conventional power plant. All three displays were ecological displays developed using an abstraction hierarchy analysis. Views were integrated in a high-space/low-time, low-space/high-time, and high-space/high-time integration of means-end related objects. During a fault detection and diagnosis task, it as found that a low level of integration, high-space/low-time, provided the fastest fault detection time. However, the most integrated condition, high-space/high-time, resulted in the fastest and most accurate fault diagnosis performance. Actual or potential applications of this research include computer displays for large-scale systems such as network management or process control, for which problem solving is critical and integration must be maintained.},

abstract = {We define situation awareness (SA) as adaptive, externally directed consciousness. This definition dispels the artificial and contentious division evident in the literature, according to which SA is either exclusively knowledge or exclusively process. This misdirected rivalry has more to do with general perspectives on the study of human behavior than with SA itself. Through defining SA as an aspect of consciousness, we hope to clarify two key issues. (1) The source of goals with respect to SA is a normative arbiter in the task environment; that is, the behavior that SA generates must be directed at an external goal. (2) SA is the invariant at the core of the agent's perception-action cycle that supports skilled performance; that is, relationships among factors or dimensions in the environment determine what the agent must know and do to achieve the goals specified by the external arbiter. We introduce a construct we call the risk space to represent the invariant relations in the environment that enable the agent to adapt to novel situations and to attain prespecified goals. We articulate this concept of a risk space through use of a specific example in commercial aircraft operations. The risk space structures information about the physical airspace in a manner that captures the momentary knowledge that drives action and that satisfies the goals and performance criteria for safe and efficient flight. We note that the risk space may be generalized to many different means of navigation.},

@article{Peffers2007,
abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. Although there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatio-temporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this article we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts, we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on the hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into the regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Based on the analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures. Interaction techniques support users in navigating the data and their visualization.

Workflow management systems have the potential to improve crisis response operations by automating coordination aspects. Unfortunately most contemporary systems can only support static workflows, hence yielding inflexible support systems. Recent work on the use of functional programming techniques for workflow modeling has led to the development of the iTask system. It uses function combination to model dynamic data-driven processes and generates executable workflow support systems. Because of its focus on dynamic processes it appears promising for development of flexible crisis response systems. In this paper we present an initial discussion of the potential of the iTask system for crisis management applications. We give an overview of the iTask system, and discuss to what extent it meets the requirements of the crisis management domain.},

abstract = {Global context plays an important, but poorly understood, role in visual tasks. This study demonstrates that a robust memory for visual context exists to guide spatial attention. Global context was operationalized as the spatial layout of objects in visual search displays. Half of the configurations were repeated across blocks throughout the entire session, and targets appeared within consistent locations in these arrays. Targets appearing in learned configurations were detected more quickly. This newly discovered form of search facilitation is termed contextual cueing. Contextual cueing is driven by incidentally learned associations between spatial configurations (context) and target locations. This benefit was obtained despite chance performance for recognizing the configurations, suggesting that the memory for context was implicit. The results show how implicit learning and memory of visual context can guide spatial attention towards task-relevant aspects of a scene.},

The framework is applied to the development of a manufacturing information system for managing the production processes for making printed circuit boards.

abstract = {Seminal works in the application of design science research (DSR) in IS emphasize the importance of evaluation. However, discussion of evaluation activities and methods is limited and typically assumes an ex post perspective, in which evaluation occurs after the construction of an IS artifact. Such perspectives can assume that the evaluation is an empirical process and its methods can be selected in the same way as empirical research methods. In this paper, we analyze a broader range of evaluation strategies, which includes ex ante (prior to artifact construction) evaluation. This broader view is developed as a strategic DSR evaluation framework, which expands evaluation choices for IS DSR researchers, and also adds emphasis to strategies for evaluating design processes in addition to design products, using well-known quality criteria as an important asset. The framework encompasses both ex ante and ex post orientations as well as naturalistic settings (e.g., case studies) and artificial settings (e.g., lab experiments) for DSR evaluation. The framework proposed offers a strategic view of DSR evaluation that is useful in analyzing published studies, and also in surfacing the evaluation opportunities that present themselves to IS DSR researchers.},

At its essence, mutual awareness refers to a fundamental quality of collaborative work, the ability of co-workers to perceive each others' activities and expressions and relate them to a joint context. In this chapter, we explore the history of awareness concepts by analysing existing literature in order to identify trends, research questions, research approaches and classification schemes throughout different stages of research into awareness. We have adopted a historical angle in the hope that it will allow us to show how awareness research has progressed over time. We document this development using three different phases: (1) Early exploration of awareness (approximately 1990--1994), (2) Diversification and research prototypes (approximately 1995--1999) and (3) Extended models and specialisation (approximately 2000--now). While these phases are to some extent arbitrary and overlapping, they allow us to highlight differences in research focus at the time and understand research in context.},

While previous work acknowledges that roles are important to understanding awareness needs, no method has yet been developed to provide a fine-grained, role-based approach to both specifying the awareness-related characteristics of collaborative computing applications and evaluating whether the application meets the awareness requirements. We have been developing a means of specifying and evaluating awareness needs in synchronous collaborative systems based on the framework presented in the paper. We feel this framework can be used by other researchers, as well, to develop methods of specifying and evaluating the ability of collaborative applications to support awareness.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to describe I-Sim, a simulation tool that is a fully integrated part of the underlying agent framework, I-X. I-Sim controls a discrete event simulator, based on the same activity model that is shared between all I-X components, and multiple process-level simulators that model the continuous change caused by actions that are considered as primitives by the rest of the system. The primary purpose of this tool is to support instructors during exercises that are used for training in emergency response. The main advantage the I-Sim tool gives the instructors is flexibility, allowing them to orchestrate and modify existing training scenarios on the fly, adapting them to trainees’ needs as required.},

In particular, we focus on the ways in which the organization of breast screening work and the design of artefacts such as report forms afford the detection of breakdowns—i.e. situations calling for departures from the “standard” procedures—and their safe and efficient repair. We use this to devise a framework for classifying different breakdown–repair scenarios. These scenarios are distinctive in their repair costs and impacts and can be used to highlight the implications of design decisions in collaborativeworksettings. Finally, we show how, via a set of derived guidelines, the results of this analysis were applied to the design of artefacts, including a user interface and computer-generated documents, for a computer-aided image analysis system intended for application in the UK breast screening programme.},

It is however, necessary to understand the context in which Emergency Responders work such that information practice issues can be highlighted and addressed by the system designers. In this paper, Activity Theory is proposed as a methodological and analytical framework to study information practices in the context of Emergency Management. Activity Theory aids in achieving a holistic approach to understanding the work activities context unlike some other analytical methodologies, as it focuses on use of artifacts for the interaction of humans with their environment. In this paper, an activity system model is used to investigate information practice issues of response phase of the emergency services in the UK. Using Activity Theory as an analytical framework, several tensions and contradictions emerged which keep the system unstable but which are also a source of innovation. It is also argued that Activity Theory can usefully be applied to the analysis of information practices over short period of time.},

Our interviews with end users have shown that current solutions for managing activities are complicated to use in the crisis by teams in the field and also in operation centers, when facing continuous unexpected events and cross-organizational activities. We propose an activity centric system for managing crisis response activities for such situations. We give an example how this system is used in a crisis within one organization and cross-organizations. Afterwards, we explain the evaluation of the solution. This research contributes not only to the crisis management domain, but also to the business process management domain by providing an alternative view on activities in highly dynamic scenarios.},

We performed a controlled experiment to study cognitive strategies and context switching by using a combination of visualizations and different task types as independent variables, and collecting qualitative and quantitative data. To collect the data, paper-based tests, logging of participants' interactions, eye-tracking, think-aloud techniques, and video recordings were used. Unlike suggestions in the literature, our results show that when considering dual-view visualizations, the time cost for context switching may not be significant, and similar visualizations may actually cause more interference. Furthermore, orthogonal combinations appear to aid users in recognizing patterns. Focusing attention and analogical reasoning on spatial relationships are important cognitive abilities as well.},

Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ (1999) 531]. This approach has been used to explain response time and accuracy differences in experimental situations where data are averaged over experimental conditions. An experiment is reported in which participants’ eye movements were recorded while they were solving various problems with different graph types. The eye movement data revealed fine grained fixation patterns that are not captured by current analyses based on optimal fixation sequences. It is argued that these patterns reveal the effects of working memory limitations during the time course of problem solving. An ACT-R/PM model of the experiment is described in which a similar pattern of eye fixations is produced as a natural consequence of the decay in activation of perceptual chunks over time.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

This approach may help to promote a better understanding of technology-mediated interaction in systems, as well as helping in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning distributed situation awareness. It is proposed that agents within a system each hold their own situation awareness, which may be very different from (although compatible with) that of other agents. It is argued that we should not always hope for, or indeed want, sharing of this awareness, as different system agents have different purposes. This view marks situation awareness as a dynamic and collaborative process binding agents together on tasks on a moment-by-moment basis. Implications of this viewpoint for the development of a new theory of, and accompanying methodology for, distributed situation awareness are offered.},

abstract = {Cartographers have long used flow maps to show the movement of objects from one location to another, such as the number of people in a migration, the amount of goods being traded, or the number of packets in a network. The advantage of flow maps is that they reduce visual clutter by merging edges. Most flow maps are drawn by hand and there are few computer algorithms available. We present a method for generating flow maps using hierarchical clustering given a set of nodes, positions, and flow data between the nodes. Our techniques are inspired by graph layout algorithms that minimize edge crossings and distort node positions while maintaining their relative position to one another. We demonstrate our technique by producing flow maps for network traffic, census data, and trade data.},

The research proposes a general visual analytic approach to synthesize very large spatial interaction data and discover interesting (and unknown) patterns. The proposed approach involves a suite of visual and computational techniques, including (1) a new graph partitioning method to segment a very large interaction graph into a moderate number of spatially contiguous subgraphs (regions); (2) a reorderable matrix, with regions ?optimally? ordered on the diagonal, to effectively present a holistic view of major spatial interaction patterns; and (3) a modified flow map, interactively linked to the reorderable matrix, to enable pattern interpretation in a geographical context.

To fulfill this requirement, emergency management systems must provide emergency managers with knowledge management and visualization tools. The goal is twofold: on one hand, to organize knowledge coming from different sources, mainly the emergency response plans (the formal knowledge) and the information extracted from the emergency development (the contextual knowledge); on the other hand, to enable effective access to information. Formal and contextual knowledge sets are mostly disjoint; however, there are cases in which a formal knowledge piece may be updated with some contextual information, constituting what we call the composite knowledge. In this paper, we extend a knowledge framework with the notion of composite knowledge, and use spatial hypertext to visualize this type of knowledge. We illustrate our proposal with a case study on accessing to information during an emergency response in an underground transportation system.},

With the advent of initiatives such as the USA Department of Defence's Network-Centric Operations and the UK Ministry of Defence's Network Enabled Capability, research into the application of service-oriented architectures (SOA) as a means of delivering capability is being undertaken. A promising output of this research is the definition of scenario based evaluation models that can be applied to SOA. This paper examines the application of a military scenario framework to more conventional software evaluation situations by means of case studies. This demonstrates that similar techniques can be used in their construction and thus provides a basis for the application of scenario based evaluation models in future research.},

abstract = {Current software tools for visualization of spatio-temporal data, on the one hand, utilize the opportunities provided by modern computer technologies, on the other hand, incorporate the legacy from the conventional cartography. We have considered existing visualization-based techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support. The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful for data analysts—users of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand, use the techniques described as basic elements for building new, more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing tools in order to satisfy these needs.},

abstract = {Over the past few years, scenario-based design has attained a growing interest as a way to incorporate a focus on the future use of an application into the construction of software. Scenarios have, however, mostly been used in the design of user-interfaces and hence focused on single-user situations. Based on experiences from applying scenarios in the re-design of an Hospital Information System in the Danish healthcare sector, this paper describes how collaborative scenarios can be used in the design of cooperative computer systems and what such col-laborative scenarios should contain. The paper concludes that such scenarios were useful in bridging the gab between understanding collaborative work practices and designing collaborative computer systems.},

abstract = {Today's data-rich environment creates its own problems since exploring and analysing vast volumes of spatio–temporal data have become increasingly difficult. It is suggested to approach this problem not only via location–space or attribute–space as is traditionally done in GIScience, but also via time–space. This time-visualisation approach considers the data, the user tasks and the visualisation representations, and aims to improve accessibility, exploration and analysis of huge amounts of geo-data to support geovisual analytics. To reach this objective, the time wave as the temporal visual representation is introduced. The time wave combines the strengths of both the timeline and the time wheel and as such is able to represent linear and cyclic time simultaneously, even at different levels of granularity. The time wave can be used in its role as temporal reference system, as temporal data representation tool, and as temporal interaction tool. It functions in combination with other graphic representations that are typical for location–space and attribute–space.},

We focus on how smallgroups perform generation and execution tasks in medium-sizedshared workspaces – tasks where group members frequently shiftbetween individual and shared activities during the work session.We have built a three-part framework that examines the concept ofworkspace awareness and that helps designers understand theconcept for purposes of designing awareness support in groupware.The framework sets out elements of knowledge that make upworkspace awareness, perceptual mechanisms used to maintainawareness, and the ways that people use workspace awareness incollaboration. The framework also organizes previous research onawareness and extends it to provide designers with a vocabularyand a set of ground rules for analysing work situations, forcomparing awareness devices, and for explaining evaluationresults. The basic structure of the theory can be used todescribe other kinds of awareness that are important to theusability of groupware.},

However, visualizing large time dependent data collected within a spatial context is still a challenging task. In this paper, we therefore describe an approach for visualizing spatio-temporal data on maps. The approach is based on two commonly used concepts: 3D information visualization and information hiding. These concepts are realized by means of novel embeddings of 3D icons into a map display for representing spatio-temporal data, and an integration of event-based methods for reducing the amount of information to be represented. Our approach is capable of visualizing multiple time dependent attributes on maps, and of emphasizing the characteristics constituted by either linear or cyclic temporal dependencies.},

Second, we present novel algorithms for efficiently propagating subscription summaries to brokers. Finally, we present a novel algorithm for the efficient distributed processing of incoming events, utilizing the propagated subscription summaries to route the events to brokers with matched subscriptions. We study the performance of our contributions, comparing them against a baseline approach and against corresponding techniques employed in a well-known event-based distributed system.

Identification of reasoning strategies used by clinicians may prove critical to the optimal design of decision support systems. This paper presents a formal method of cognitive-semantic analysis for the identification and characterization of reasoning strategies deployed in medical tasks and demonstrates its use through specific examples. Although semantic analysis was originally developed in the investigation of knowledge structures, it can also be applied to identify the reasoning and decision processes used by physicians and medical trainees in clinical tasks. Assumptions underlying the methods, as well as illustrations of their use in diagnostic explanation tasks, are presented. We discuss semantic analysis in the context of the current interests in developing medical ontologies and argue that a frame-based propositional analytic methodology can provide a systematic way of addressing the construction of such ontologies. Although the application of propositional analysis methods has some limitations, we show how such limitations are being addressed and present some examples of information tools that have been developed to ease, and make more systematic, the process of analysis.},

abstract = {Technological systems involving hazards are typically managed by experienced personnel guided by well-formulated, pre-determined procedures. These procedures are designed to ensure that operations proceed in a safe and cost-effective manner. Yet normal operations in these systems are exposed to unexpected contingencies that can require personnel to develop and deploy new procedures in real-time. Creative thinking in such situations is therefore necessary in order to prevent degradation of operations, particularly when there is potential for personal injury, economic loss or environmental damage. One approach to addressing these situations is improvisation. The research described here discusses a series of studies conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a computer-based system for supporting improvisation in simulated crisis situations. The design and implementation of the system are first discussed, drawing upon prior work in blackboard-based systems. The experimental design is then reviewed, followed by a discussion of how the studies were run using groups of emergency response personnel from the Port of Rotterdam in The Netherlands. The group task was to address unexpected contingencies in a timely fashion. A number of measures of group decision effectiveness and uniqueness are presented. Results of the studies suggest that availability of decision support may have had an uneven influence on solution effectiveness and no influence on solution uniqueness. Possible implications for the design of group decision support systems for improvisation are then discussed, along with a number of observations on conducting experimentally-based research on group improvisation.},

abstract = {Event notification services enable loose coupling and they are therefore becoming an essential part of distributed systems’ design. However, the development of event services follows the early stages of programming language evolution, disregarding the need for efficient mechanisms to structure event-based applications. In this paper, the well-known notion of scopes is introduced to event-based systems. We show that limiting the visibility of events is a simple yet powerful mechanism that allows to identify application structure and offers a module construct for the loosely coupled components in event-based systems. We are able to customize the semantics of scoped event notification services by binding meta-objects to the application structure that reify important aspects of notification delivery, like interface mappings and transmission policies. The scoping concept facilitates design and implementation by offering encapsulation and adaption of syntax and semantics of event-based systems.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the utility of an explanatory and predictive account of awareness in the (re)design of complex human–computer interaction. We start by describing both the wider field of human computer awareness and the specific sub-field of situation awareness in the aviation domain. We also discuss the wide range of observations and descriptions, which detail both success and failure in the acquisition, maintenance and repair of such awareness across a range of domains. Next, we assert the need for an explanatory and predictive model of the phenomenon in the search for a reduction in the breakdowns reported and propose such a model. We then go on to investigate the utility of our model as a guide for design through the discussion of a recent experiment involving manipulations of an animated warning signal on a simulated cockpit control panel. Our results show initial support both for the model and for our earlier assertion of its utility. We conclude that our composite view of awareness yields practical benefit in the design of human computer awareness support and provides a basis for future research.},

abstract = {The issue of how to support situation awareness among operators of complex systems or vehicles is a growing concern in a number of industries, especially when automation takes the operators partly "out of the loop." Cognitive theory suggests that comprehension of the flow of events is an active process, constrained by the dynamics and modularity of attention and memory. Focusing on issues of commercial aviation, we review the meaning of the term situation awareness both definition ally and by way of examples. We then discuss the cognitive factors involved in achieving and maintaining situation awareness, drawing on recent cognitive theory to clarify their interactions. Finally, having emphasized the need for a more analytic and precise understanding of situation awareness, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of various empirical approaches that might be used toward that end.},

Background: In her articles, Endsley integrated and consolidated existing research done in the prior decade. Method: I carefully examined and integrated subsequent articles on the SA topic written by Endsley and by others. Results: This integration revealed that SA has been applied to areas of training, error analysis, design, selection, teamwork, and automation. Some key issues related to automation and SA are reviewed in detail. Conclusion: Situation awareness is a viable and important construct that still possesses some controversy over measurement issues. Application: Ways in which human factors practitioners have used the SA construct and numerous citations are provided to assist designers.},

This perspectiverequires a deeper understanding of the ways andmeans people adopt to deal with awarenessinformation as well as considering theintegration of awareness tools with toolssupporting other forms of coordination. First,we suggest to consider two types of awareness:by-product awareness that is generated in thecourse of the activities people must do inorder to accomplish their cooperative tasks;and add-on awareness that is the outcome of anadditional activity, which is a neat cost forthe cooperating actors in relation to what theymust do and is discretional in that it dependson actors' evaluation of the contingentsituation. Secondly, we propose areaction-diffusion metaphor to describe theawareness phenomenology and to take intoaccount the two above-mentioned types ofawareness integration. The model ofawareness derived from the metaphor makesvisible and accessible by different types ofusers a set of elemental primitives whoseflexible composition allows them to constructthe awareness mechanisms they dynamically need. These primitives are incorporated in a softwaremodule that can be used in combination withcoordinative applications for sake of promotingawareness information. The main architectureof the module is presented together with itsinteroperability with the target application;moreover, a simple example illustrates how theincorporated primitives can be used to buildawareness mechanisms.},

abstract = {Information foraging and sensemaking with heterogeneous information are context-dependent activities. Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web-based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.},

Broadcast of large amounts of alerts sent back to command centers for processing may impair the ability of analysts to connect dots that may otherwise adequately enable them to make informed decisions in a timely fashion. This paper investigates trends and patterns embedded in alert notifications generated over a given period of time in order to uncover correlations that may exist in the data. Data for this study are obtained from the National Center for Crisis and Continuity Coordination (NC4). We employ classical time series analysis to understand, explain and predict trends and patterns in the data.
