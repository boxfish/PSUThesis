abstract = {Because computers often rely on visual displays as a way to convey information to a user, recent research suggesting that people have detailed awareness of only a small subset of the visual environment has important implications for human-computer interface design. Equally important to basic limits of awareness is the fact that people often over-predict what they will see and become aware of. Together, basic failures of awareness and people's failure to intuitively understand them may account for situations where computer users fail to obtain critical information from a display even when the designer intended to make the information highly visible and easy to apprehend. To minimize the deleterious effects of failures of awareness, it is important for users and especially designers to be mindful of the circumscribed nature of visual awareness. In this article, we review basic and applied research documenting failures of visual awareness and the related metacognitive failure and then discuss misplaced beliefs that could accentuate both in the context of the human-computer interface.

abstract = {The idea of a “common artefact” is a useful metaphor for the design of CSCW systems. Our ACCT model of a common artefact describes structural elements that provide awareness about the work of others. The ACCT model identifies actors, contents, conversations, and tools as the central components of a common artefact, arranged on a shared background. The elements of a common artefact provide both a background visualization of the activity, but also permit dynamic notification of particular events. We explore this process of notification, which is composed of a selection and a presentation stage. We identify the critical factors of the process, in particular we highlight techniques related to temporal and spatial distortion. The framework helps to prepare design decisions of multi-user systems more consciously.},

AREA uses a semantic model of the client applications to support cross-application awareness. The service is based on the dichotomy of interest and privacy. Notifications of user activities are a function of relevance in the current work situation and the privacy requirements of the involved users. The paper motivates the AREA framework and discusses the system in terms of its formal modeling capabilities and its operational aspects. This is followed by practical implementation considerations addressing the role of AREA as a groupware infrastructure. Finally, a prototype groupware application is presented, which uses the AREAservicetosupportuserawareness.},

Starting from the so-called metaphor of the box, we firstly show that the mechanisms of contextual reasoning proposed in the literature can be classified into three general forms (called localized reasoning, push and pop, and shifting). Secondly, we provide a justification of this classification, by showing that each mechanism corresponds to operating on a fundamental dimension along which context dependent representations may vary (namely, partiality, approximation and perspective). From the previous analysis, we distill two general principles of a logic of contextual reasoning. Finally, we show that these two principles can be adequately formalized in the framework of MultiContext Systems.

abstract = {Cartographers have long used flow maps to show the movement of objects from one location to another, such as the number of people in a migration, the amount of goods being traded, or the number of packets in a network. The advantage of flow maps is that they reduce visual clutter by merging edges. Most flow maps are drawn by hand and there are few computer algorithms available. We present a method for generating flow maps using hierarchical clustering given a set of nodes, positions, and flow data between the nodes. Our techniques are inspired by graph layout algorithms that minimize edge crossings and distort node positions while maintaining their relative position to one another. We demonstrate our technique by producing flow maps for network traffic, census data, and trade data.},

In this paper, we propose to establish an upper event-ontology in order-sorted logic as an infrastructure for event knowledge bases. Our event ontology contains a classification of event entities (e.g., natural events and artificial events) and event relationships (e.g., causal relations and next-event relations). These ontological characterizations are needed for a theoretical basis of applications such as implementation of event databases, detection of event relationships, and annotation of event data.},

abstract = {Models of graph-based reasoning have typically accounted for the variation in problem solving performance with different graph types in terms of a task analysis of the problem relative to the particular visual properties of each graph type [e.g., Human Computer Interaction 8 (1993) 353; Proceedings of the Twenty-first Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society. Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Mahwah, NJ (1999) 531]. This approach has been used to explain response time and accuracy differences in experimental situations where data are averaged over experimental conditions. An experiment is reported in which participants’ eye movements were recorded while they were solving various problems with different graph types. The eye movement data revealed fine grained fixation patterns that are not captured by current analyses based on optimal fixation sequences. It is argued that these patterns reveal the effects of working memory limitations during the time course of problem solving. An ACT-R/PM model of the experiment is described in which a similar pattern of eye fixations is produced as a natural consequence of the decay in activation of perceptual chunks over time.},

To help distributed collaborators maintain mutual awareness of people's electronic work artifacts, we designed and implemented an awareness tool that leverages screen-sharing methods. People see portions of others’ screens in miniature, can selectively raise larger views of a screen to get more detail, and can engage in remote pointing. People balance awareness with privacy by using several privacy-protection strategies built into the system. A preliminary evaluation with two groups using this system shows that people use it to maintain awareness of what others are doing, project a certain image of themselves, monitor progress, coordinate joint tasks, determine others’ availability, and engage in serendipitous conversation and collaboration. While privacy was not a large concern for these groups, a theoretical analysis suggests that privacy risks may differ for other user communities.},

It is however, necessary to understand the context in which Emergency Responders work such that information practice issues can be highlighted and addressed by the system designers. In this paper, Activity Theory is proposed as a methodological and analytical framework to study information practices in the context of Emergency Management. Activity Theory aids in achieving a holistic approach to understanding the work activities context unlike some other analytical methodologies, as it focuses on use of artifacts for the interaction of humans with their environment. In this paper, an activity system model is used to investigate information practice issues of response phase of the emergency services in the UK. Using Activity Theory as an analytical framework, several tensions and contradictions emerged which keep the system unstable but which are also a source of innovation. It is also argued that Activity Theory can usefully be applied to the analysis of information practices over short period of time.},

Because no single article can encompass all behavioral phenomena, one construct, situation awareness (SA) has been selected as a case study to show what activity theory can do. SA as described by Endsley (1995) is not a simple construct but incorporates almost all variables involved in a comprehensive theory of human behavior, with particular attention to its cognitive elements. SA phenomena include aspects of attention, perception, symbol analysis and interpretation, memory, anticipation of future states, deduction from partial information, and so forth. The position is advanced that SA phenomena can only be understood as part of the structure of a comprehensive theory of activity. In particular, SA must be viewed as part of cognitive activity that is intensely dynamic.

A dynamic theory of context is presented which defines context as the dynamic state of human mind. It describes the interaction between memory, perception, and reasoning in forming context as well as how they are influenced by context. A general cognitive architecture, DUAL, is presented that implements the mechanisms of context formation and accounts for the context-sensitivity of human cognition. A model of human problem solving, AMBR, has been built upon the DUAL architecture and the simulation experiments performed with it produce data that are coherent with experimental data on human problem solving.},

abstract = {Today's data-rich environment creates its own problems since exploring and analysing vast volumes of spatio–temporal data have become increasingly difficult. It is suggested to approach this problem not only via location–space or attribute–space as is traditionally done in GIScience, but also via time–space. This time-visualisation approach considers the data, the user tasks and the visualisation representations, and aims to improve accessibility, exploration and analysis of huge amounts of geo-data to support geovisual analytics. To reach this objective, the time wave as the temporal visual representation is introduced. The time wave combines the strengths of both the timeline and the time wheel and as such is able to represent linear and cyclic time simultaneously, even at different levels of granularity. The time wave can be used in its role as temporal reference system, as temporal data representation tool, and as temporal interaction tool. It functions in combination with other graphic representations that are typical for location–space and attribute–space.},

abstract = {The question of how to conceive and represent the context of work is explored from the theoretical perspective of distributed cognition. It is argued that to understand the office work context we need to go beyond tracking superficial physical attributes such as who or what is where and when and consider the state of digital resources, people's concepts, task state, social relations, and the local work culture, to name a few. In analyzing an office more deeply, three concepts are especially helpful: entry points, action landscapes, and coordinating mechanisms. An entry point is a structure or cue that represents an invitation to enter an information space or office task. An activity landscape is part mental construct and part physical; it is the space users interactively construct out of the resources they find when trying to accomplish a task. A coordinating mechanism is an artifact, such as a schedule or clock, or an environmental structure such as the layout of papers to be signed, which helps a user manage the complexity of his task. Using these three concepts we can abstract away from many of the surface attributes of work context and define the deep structure of a setting-the invariant structure that many office settings share.

The framework is applied to the development of a manufacturing information system for managing the production processes for making printed circuit boards.

abstract = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research.

annote = {Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology.

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to propose foundations for a theory of situation awareness based on the analysis of interactions between agents (i.e. both human and non-human) in subsystems. This approach may help to promote a better understanding of technology-mediated interaction in systems, as well as helping in the formulation of hypotheses and predictions concerning distributed situation awareness. It is proposed that agents within a system each hold their own situation awareness, which may be very different from (although compatible with) that of other agents. It is argued that we should not always hope for, or indeed want, sharing of this awareness, as different system agents have different purposes. This view marks situation awareness as a dynamic and collaborative process binding agents together on tasks on a moment-by-moment basis. Implications of this viewpoint for the development of a new theory of, and accompanying methodology for, distributed situation awareness are offered.},

We propose an activity centric system for managing crisis response activities for such situations.

The framework also organizes previous research onawareness and extends it to provide designers with a vocabularyand a set of ground rules for analysing work situations, forcomparing awareness devices, and for explaining evaluationresults. The basic structure of the theory can be used todescribe other kinds of awareness that are important to theusability of groupware.},

In this article, the concept is adopted for a user?centered design of geovisualization application. The premise is that using simple and clear design can lead to successful applications with improved ease of use. Over the last three decades, the development of GIS and geovisualization has seen a marked increase in the levels of interaction between the user, the system and the information. However, these enthusiastic advances in technology have not resulted in a significant increase in the number of users. This article suggests that types of user interaction should not simply emphasize traditional GIS functions such as zooming and panning but move towards interaction based on facilitating the knowledge construction process. Considerations are made for the complexity of the system, the task at hand and the skills and limitations of the users. These elements are particularly important when maps act as the mediators in collaboration with users across disciplinary backgrounds. In such cases, the emphasis on simplicity and usability becomes as important as functionality. In these situations a geovisualization application designed for specific uses can maximize effective development of geographic knowledge. In this article, a minimalistic design approach to geovisualization is adopted by creating a geographic profiling tool which shifts the emphasis from technological advances or interaction with the map to the interaction elements key to building the spatial knowledge of GIS experts and non?experts alike. To evaluate this notion of ?less?is?more geovisualization? the profiling tool is evaluated according to usability matrices: efficiency, effectiveness and learnability.

Workflow management systems have the potential to improve crisis response operations by automating coordination aspects. Unfortunately most contemporary systems can only support static workflows, hence yielding inflexible support systems. Recent work on the use of functional programming techniques for workflow modeling has led to the development of the iTask system. It uses function combination to model dynamic data-driven processes and generates executable workflow support systems. Because of its focus on dynamic processes it appears promising for development of flexible crisis response systems. In this paper we present an initial discussion of the potential of the iTask system for crisis management applications. We give an overview of the iTask system, and discuss to what extent it meets the requirements of the crisis management domain.},

In conclusion, whilst the ideas presented in this article are quite different to those expressed by the dominant models of individual and team SA presented in the literature, it is contended that they are more appropriate for the study of SA in collaborative environments.},

@article{Sonnenwald2000,
abstract = {In many dynamic work situations, no single individual can acquire the varied and often rapidly expanding information needed for success. Individuals must work together to collect, analyze, synthesize and disseminate information throughout the work process. Perhaps one of the most dynamic work contexts is command and control in the military at the battalion level which directs 300 to 1000 soldiers on the battlefield. This paper reports on a study that explores human information behavior in command and control (C2). Data was gathered from simulated battle exercises, interviews with experienced C2 personnel and documentation on C2. During data analysis, three important themes that highlight the why, what, how and consequences of information behavior in C2 emerged. The first is the concept of interwoven situational awareness consisting of individual, intragroup and intergroup shared understanding of the situation. Interwoven situational awareness appears to facilitate response to dynamic, constraint-bound situations. The second theme describes the need for dense social networks or frequent communication between participants about the work context and situation, the work process and domain-specific information. The third theme is called ‘contested collaboration’, a phenomenon where team members maintain an outward stance of cooperation but work to further their own interests, at times sabotaging the collaborative effort. These results provide insights to the complex nature of human information behavior in dynamic and complex work contexts and lead to recommendations for training and further research.},

abstract = {Reasoning strategies are a key component in many medical tasks, including decision making, clinical problem solving, and understanding of medical texts. Identification of reasoning strategies used by clinicians may prove critical to the optimal design of decision support systems. This paper presents a formal method of cognitive-semantic analysis for the identification and characterization of reasoning strategies deployed in medical tasks and demonstrates its use through specific examples. Although semantic analysis was originally developed in the investigation of knowledge structures, it can also be applied to identify the reasoning and decision processes used by physicians and medical trainees in clinical tasks. Assumptions underlying the methods, as well as illustrations of their use in diagnostic explanation tasks, are presented. We discuss semantic analysis in the context of the current interests in developing medical ontologies and argue that a frame-based propositional analytic methodology can provide a systematic way of addressing the construction of such ontologies. Although the application of propositional analysis methods has some limitations, we show how such limitations are being addressed and present some examples of information tools that have been developed to ease, and make more systematic, the process of analysis.},

Nowadays, structural information is becoming more and more important. Hierarchies, for instance, are frequently applied to make large and complex data manageable. Hence, a visual depiction of hierarchical structures in space and time is required. Although there are several techniques addressing specific aspects of spatio-temporal visualization, approaches that cope with space, time, data, and structure are rare. With this article we take a step to fill this gap. By combining various well-established concepts, we achieve a reasonably complete visualization of all of the aforementioned aspects, where our focus is on the hierarchical structures. We embed hierarchies directly into the regions of a map display using variants of the point-based layout. Layering and animation are applied to visualize temporal aspects. Based on the analysis goals, users can switch between representations that emphasize data attributes or hierarchical structures.

abstract = {Global context plays an important, but poorly understood, role in visual tasks. This study demonstrates that a robust memory for visual context exists to guide spatial attention. Global context was operationalized as the spatial layout of objects in visual search displays. Half of the configurations were repeated across blocks throughout the entire session, and targets appeared within consistent locations in these arrays. Targets appearing in learned configurations were detected more quickly. This newly discovered form of search facilitation is termed contextual cueing. Contextual cueing is driven by incidentally learned associations between spatial configurations (context) and target locations. This benefit was obtained despite chance performance for recognizing the configurations, suggesting that the memory for context was implicit. The results show how implicit learning and memory of visual context can guide spatial attention towards task-relevant aspects of a scene.},

abstract = {The paper outlines an approach to CSCW systems design based on the concept of `coordination mechanisms.'The concept of coordination mechanisms has been developed as a generalization of phenomena described in empirical investigations of the use of artifacts for the purpose of coordinating cooperative activities in different work domains. On the basis of the evidence of this corpus of empirical studies, the paper outlines a theory of the use of artifacts for coordination purposes in cooperative work settings, derives a set of general requirements for computational coordination mechanisms, and sketches the architecture of Ariadne, a CSCW infrastructure for constructing and running such malleable and linkable computational coordination mechanisms.},

abstract = {The visual analysis of time dependent data is an essential task in many application fields. However, visualizing large time dependent data collected within a spatial context is still a challenging task. In this paper, we therefore describe an approach for visualizing spatio-temporal data on maps. The approach is based on two commonly used concepts: 3D information visualization and information hiding. These concepts are realized by means of novel embeddings of 3D icons into a map display for representing spatio-temporal data, and an integration of event-based methods for reducing the amount of information to be represented. Our approach is capable of visualizing multiple time dependent attributes on maps, and of emphasizing the characteristics constituted by either linear or cyclic temporal dependencies.},

abstract = {Real cognitive maps encoded by humans are difficult to study using experimental methods because they are a product of complex processes whose content and timing cannot easily be known or controlled. This paper assesses the value of using neural network model simulations for investigating cognitive maps. The study simulated the learning of mapped city locations in South Carolina from reference sites in the three primary regions of the state using Kohonen self-organizing maps. The learning performances of models were considered based on available prior knowledge. Bi-dimensional regression analyses were used to assess the congruity of the simulated cognitive maps with a cartographic map and with sketch maps produced by human subjects. Error analyses indicated differences between central and peripheral reference sites. The cities known by subjects living at a central location were more evenly distributed in space and associated with significantly smaller errors. Models that learned combined state boundary and interstate highway information as prior knowledge or simultaneously with city locations consistently produced the best simulation results. The results indicated simulated cognitive maps could be used effectively to study the acquisition of spatial knowledge.},

abstract = {Information foraging and sensemaking with heterogeneous information are context-dependent activities. Thus visual analytics tools to support these activities must incorporate context. But, context is a difficult concept to define, model, and represent. Creating and representing context in support of visually-enabled reasoning about complex problems with complex information is a complementary but different challenge than that addressed in context-aware computing. In the latter, the goal is automated adaptation of the system to meet user needs for applications such as mobile location-based services where information about the location, the user, and the user goals filters what gets presented on a small mobile device. In contrast, for visual analytics-enabled information foraging and sensemaking, the user is likely to take an active role in foraging for the contextual information needed to support sensemaking in relation to some multifaceted problem. In this paper, we address the challenges of constructing and representing context within visual interfaces that support analytical reasoning in crisis management and humanitarian relief. The challenges stem from the diverse forms of information that can provide context and difficulty in defining and operationalizing context itself. Here, we pay particular attention to document foraging to support construction of the geographic and historical context within which monitoring and sensemaking can be carried out. Specifically, we present the concept of geo-historical context (GHC) and outline an empirical assessment of both the concept and its implementation in the Context Discovery Application, a web-based tool that supports document foraging and sensemaking.},

abstract = {Mutual awareness has been a focus point of research in Human--Computer Interaction (HCI) and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) since the early 1990s. At its essence, mutual awareness refers to a fundamental quality of collaborative work, the ability of co-workers to perceive each others' activities and expressions and relate them to a joint context. In this chapter, we explore the history of awareness concepts by analysing existing literature in order to identify trends, research questions, research approaches and classification schemes throughout different stages of research into awareness. We have adopted a historical angle in the hope that it will allow us to show how awareness research has progressed over time. We document this development using three different phases: (1) Early exploration of awareness (approximately 1990--1994), (2) Diversification and research prototypes (approximately 1995--1999) and (3) Extended models and specialisation (approximately 2000--now). While these phases are to some extent arbitrary and overlapping, they allow us to highlight differences in research focus at the time and understand research in context.},

Collaborative Systems support them enabling a shared environment and informing of its state and changes through a mechanism called Awareness. In this paper we argue that these changes and their consequences can be understood in an ontological work context (we call it “semantic awareness”). This approach allows us to infer the relevance of the awareness information and control its delivery. To do so, we determine a user context (location, device, preferences), which allows us to infer the user willingness to be exposed to this information. The mechanism is enabled through a Multi-Agent System (MAS), where an agency represents each user’s perception and actual context. We also present a case study and discuss the obtained results.},

We have also identified that shared and team situation awareness tends to be viewed only in terms of cooperative task completion and so we have tried to describe their important relationship with team decision making. The applicability of our approaches is demonstrated by a case study of mass evacuation in the case of a tsunami event. We show how ontology can be used to represent context-based situations and how the axioms and rules can improve team situation awareness.},

abstract = {The issue of how to support situation awareness among operators of complex systems or vehicles is a growing concern in a number of industries, especially when automation takes the operators partly "out of the loop." Cognitive theory suggests that comprehension of the flow of events is an active process, constrained by the dynamics and modularity of attention and memory. Focusing on issues of commercial aviation, we review the meaning of the term situation awareness both definition ally and by way of examples. We then discuss the cognitive factors involved in achieving and maintaining situation awareness, drawing on recent cognitive theory to clarify their interactions. Finally, having emphasized the need for a more analytic and precise understanding of situation awareness, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of various empirical approaches that might be used toward that end.},

abstract = {Development of context-aware applications is inherently complex. These applications adapt to changing context information: physical context, computational context, and user context/tasks. Context information is gathered from a variety of sources that differ in the quality of information they produce and that are often failure prone. The pervasive computing community increasingly understands that developing context-aware applications should be supported by adequate context information modelling and reasoningtechniques. These techniques reduce the complexity of context-aware applications and improve their maintainability and evolvability. In this paper we discuss the requirements that contextmodelling and reasoningtechniques should meet, including the modelling of a variety of context information types and their relationships, of high-level context abstractions describing real world situations using context information facts, of histories of context information, and of uncertainty of context information. This discussion is followed by a description and comparison of current contextmodelling and reasoningtechniques and a lesson learned from this comparison.},

abstract = {Technological systems involving hazards are typically managed by experienced personnel guided by well-formulated, pre-determined procedures. These procedures are designed to ensure that operations proceed in a safe and cost-effective manner. Yet normal operations in these systems are exposed to unexpected contingencies that can require personnel to develop and deploy new procedures in real-time. Creative thinking in such situations is therefore necessary in order to prevent degradation of operations, particularly when there is potential for personal injury, economic loss or environmental damage. One approach to addressing these situations is improvisation. The research described here discusses a series of studies conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a computer-based system for supporting improvisation in simulated crisis situations. The design and implementation of the system are first discussed, drawing upon prior work in blackboard-based systems. The experimental design is then reviewed, followed by a discussion of how the studies were run using groups of emergency response personnel from the Port of Rotterdam in The Netherlands. The group task was to address unexpected contingencies in a timely fashion. A number of measures of group decision effectiveness and uniqueness are presented. Results of the studies suggest that availability of decision support may have had an uneven influence on solution effectiveness and no influence on solution uniqueness. Possible implications for the design of group decision support systems for improvisation are then discussed, along with a number of observations on conducting experimentally-based research on group improvisation.},

abstract = {The paper motivates, presents, demonstrates in use, and evaluates a methodology for conducting design science (DS) research in information systems (IS). DS is of importance in a discipline oriented to the creation of successful artifacts. Several researchers have pioneered DS research in IS, yet over the past 15 years, little DS research has been done within the discipline. The lack of a methodology to serve as a commonly accepted framework for DS research and of a template for its presentation may have contributed to its slow adoption. The design science research methodology (DSRM) presented here incorporates principles, practices, and procedures required to carry out such research and meets three objectives: it is consistent with prior literature, it provides a nominal process model for doing DS research, and it provides a mental model for presenting and evaluating DS research in IS. The DS process includes six steps: problem identification and motivation, definition of the objectives for a solution, design and development, demonstration, evaluation, and communication. We demonstrate and evaluate the methodology by presenting four case studies in terms of the DSRM, including cases that present the design of a database to support health assessment methods, a software reuse measure, an Internet video telephony application, and an IS planning method. The designed methodology effectively satisfies the three objectives and has the potential to help aid the acceptance of DS research in the IS discipline.},

However, the development of event services follows the early stages of programming language evolution, disregarding the need for efficient mechanisms to structure event-based applications. In this paper, the well-known notion of scopes is introduced to event-based systems. We show that limiting the visibility of events is a simple yet powerful mechanism that allows to identify application structure and offers a module construct for the loosely coupled components in event-based systems. We are able to customize the semantics of scoped event notification services by binding meta-objects to the application structure that reify important aspects of notification delivery, like interface mappings and transmission policies. The scoping concept facilitates design and implementation by offering encapsulation and adaption of syntax and semantics of event-based systems.},

Broadcast of large amounts of alerts sent back to command centers for processing may impair the ability of analysts to connect dots that may otherwise adequately enable them to make informed decisions in a timely fashion. This paper investigates trends and patterns embedded in alert notifications generated over a given period of time in order to uncover correlations that may exist in the data. Data for this study are obtained from the National Center for Crisis and Continuity Coordination (NC4). We employ classical time series analysis to understand, explain and predict trends and patterns in the data. This work presents results obtained thus far in the quest for the effect of passage of time on alert patterns. Implications of this work in practice and research are discussed.},

With the advent of initiatives such as the USA Department of Defence's Network-Centric Operations and the UK Ministry of Defence's Network Enabled Capability, research into the application of service-oriented architectures (SOA) as a means of delivering capability is being undertaken. A promising output of this research is the definition of scenario based evaluation models that can be applied to SOA. This paper examines the application of a military scenario framework to more conventional software evaluation situations by means of case studies. This demonstrates that similar techniques can be used in their construction and thus provides a basis for the application of scenario based evaluation models in future research.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a computational model of dialogue, and an underlying theory of action, which supports the representation of, reasoning about and execution of communicative and non-communicative actions. This model rests on a theory of collaborative discourse, and allows for cooperative human–machine communication in written dialogues. We show how cooperative behaviour, illustrated by the analysis of adialogue corpus and formalized by an underlying theory of cooperation, is interpreted and produced in our model. We describe and illustrate in detail the main algorithms used to model the reasoning processes necessary for interpretation, planning, generation, as well as for determining which actions to perform and when. Finally, we present our implemented system. Our data are drawn from a corpus of human–human dialogues, selected and transcribed from a day-long recording of phone calls at a phone desk in an industrial setting (Castaing, 1993). We present an analysis of this corpus, focusing on dialogues which require, in order to succeed, helpful behaviour on the part of both the caller and the operator. The theoretical framework of our model rests on the theory of collaborative discourse developed by Grosz and Sidner (1986, 1990), Grosz and Kraus (1993, 1996), and further extended by Lochbaum (1994, 1995). An important objective guiding the design of our dialoguemodel was to allow the agent being modelled to interpret and manifest a type of cooperative behaviour which follows Grosz and Kraus's formalization of the commitment of each collaborative agent towards the actions of the other collaborative agents. The model we propose extends Lochbaum's approach to discourse processing in extending her interpretation algorithm to allow for the treatment of a wider range of dialogues, and in providing an algorithm of task advancement which guides the generation process and allows for the interleaving of execution and planning, thereby facilitating cooperation among agents. The cooperative behaviour of the agent being modelled rests on the use of communicative actions allowing agents to share additional knowledge and assist each other in performing their actions.},

abstract = {We contribute a new paradigm for publish/subscribe systems. It is centered on the novel notion of subscription summarization. We first present the summarization structures for a broker's subscriptions and accompanying algorithms, which operate on the summary structures to match incoming events to the brokers with relevant subscriptions and for the maintenance of subscriptions in the face of updates. Second, we present novel algorithms for efficiently propagating subscription summaries to brokers. Finally, we present a novel algorithm for the efficient distributed processing of incoming events, utilizing the propagated subscription summaries to route the events to brokers with matched subscriptions. We study the performance of our contributions, comparing them against a baseline approach and against corresponding techniques employed in a well-known event-based distributed system. Our results show the significant performance gains introduced for both the subscription propagation and distributed event processing tasks.},

abstract = {In this paper we investigate the utility of an explanatory and predictive account of awareness in the (re)design of complex human–computer interaction. We start by describing both the wider field of human computer awareness and the specific sub-field of situation awareness in the aviation domain. We also discuss the wide range of observations and descriptions, which detail both success and failure in the acquisition, maintenance and repair of such awareness across a range of domains. Next, we assert the need for an explanatory and predictive model of the phenomenon in the search for a reduction in the breakdowns reported and propose such a model. We then go on to investigate the utility of our model as a guide for design through the discussion of a recent experiment involving manipulations of an animated warning signal on a simulated cockpit control panel. Our results show initial support both for the model and for our earlier assertion of its utility. We conclude that our composite view of awareness yields practical benefit in the design of human computer awareness support and provides a basis for future research.},

abstract = {Having the right information at the right time is crucial to make decisions during emergency responses. To fulfill this requirement, emergency management systems must provide emergency managers with knowledge management and visualization tools. The goal is twofold: on one hand, to organize knowledge coming from different sources, mainly the emergency response plans (the formal knowledge) and the information extracted from the emergency development (the contextual knowledge); on the other hand, to enable effective access to information. Formal and contextual knowledge sets are mostly disjoint; however, there are cases in which a formal knowledge piece may be updated with some contextual information, constituting what we call the composite knowledge. In this paper, we extend a knowledge framework with the notion of composite knowledge, and use spatial hypertext to visualize this type of knowledge. We illustrate our proposal with a case study on accessing to information during an emergency response in an underground transportation system.},

abstract = {This article introduces a new theory of intention representation which is based on a structure called a Dynamic Intention Structure (DIS). The theory of DISs was motivated by the problem of how to properly represent incompletely specified intentions and their evolution. Since the plans and intentions of collaborating agents are most often elaborated incrementally and jointly, elaboration processes naturally involve agreements among agents on the identity of appropriate agents, objects and properties that figure into their joint plans. The paper builds on ideas from dynamic logic to present a solution to the representation and evolution of agent intentions involving reference to incompletely specified and, possibly, mutually dependent intentions, as well as the objects referenced within those intentions. It provides a first order semantics for the resulting logic. A companion paper extends further the logical form of DISs and explores the problem of logical consequence and intention revision.},

abstract = {An adequate formulation of collective intentionality is crucial for understanding group activity and for modeling the mental state of participants in such activities. Although work on collective intentionality in philosophy, artificial intelligence, and cognitive science has many points of agreement, several key issues remain under debate. This paper argues that the dynamics of intention – in particular, the inter-related processes of plan-related group decision making and intention updating – play crucial roles in an explanation of collective intentionality. Furthermore, it is in these dynamic aspects that coordinated group activity differs most from individual activity. The paper specifies a model of the dynamics of agent intentions in the context of collaborativeactivity. Its integrated treatment of group decision making and coordinated updating of group-related intentions fills an important gap in prior accounts of collective intentionality, thus helping to resolve a long-standing debate about the nature of intentions in group activity. The paper also defines an architecture for collaboration-capable computer agents that satisfies the constraints of the model and is a natural extension of the standard architecture for resource-bounded agents operating as individuals. The new architecture is both more principled and more complete than prior architectures for collaborative multi-agent systems.},

We performed a controlled experiment to study cognitive strategies and context switching by using a combination of visualizations and different task types as independent variables, and collecting qualitative and quantitative data. To collect the data, paper-based tests, logging of participants' interactions, eye-tracking, think-aloud techniques, and video recordings were used. Unlike suggestions in the literature, our results show that when considering dual-view visualizations, the time cost for context switching may not be significant, and similar visualizations may actually cause more interference. Furthermore, orthogonal combinations appear to aid users in recognizing patterns. Focusing attention and analogical reasoning on spatial relationships are important cognitive abilities as well.},

We have considered existing visualization-based techniques for exploratory analysis of spatio-temporal data from two perspectives: (1) what types of spatio-temporal data they are applicable to; (2) what exploratory tasks they can potentially support. The technique investigation has been based on an operational typology of spatio-temporal data and analytical tasks we specially devised for this purpose. The result of the study is a structured inventory of existing exploratory techniques related to the types of data and tasks they are appropriate for. This result is potentially helpful for data analysts—users of geovisualization tools: it provides guidelines for selection of proper exploratory techniques depending on the characteristics of data to analyze and the goals of analysis. At the same time the inventory as well as the suggested typology of tasks could be useful for tool designers and developers of various domain-specific geovisualization applications. The designers can, on the one hand, see what task types are insufficiently supported by the existing tools and direct their creative activities towards filling the gaps, on the other hand, use the techniques described as basic elements for building new, more sophisticated ones. The application developers can, on the one hand, use the task and data typology in the analysis of potential user needs, on the other hand, appropriately select and combine existing tools in order to satisfy these needs.},

This capability has been investigated in contexts such as intelligent interface designs and operation support systems. While some progress has been demonstrated, efforts to date have focused on a single operator. In large and complex artefacts such as power plants or aircrafts, however, ateam generally operates the system, and teamintention is not reducible to mere summation of individual intentions. It is therefore necessary to develop ateamintentioninferencemethod for sophisticated team–machine communication. In this paper amethod is proposed for teamintentioninference in process domains. The method uses expectations of the other members as clues to infer ateamintention and describes it as a set of individual intentions and beliefs of the other team members. We applied it to the operation of a plant simulator operated by a two-person team, and it was shown that, at least in this context, the method is effective for teamintentioninference.},

However, these studies have overlooked a different aspect of awareness practices: the identification of the social actors who should be monitored and the actors to whom their actions should be displayed . The focus of this paper is on how social actors answer the following questions: to whom should I display my actions? And, whose actions should I monitor? Ethnographic data from two software development teams are used to answer these questions. In addition, we illustrate how software developers’ work practices are influenced by three different factors: the organizational setting, the age of the project, and the software architecture.},

Based on a proposed conceptual framework that models the relationships between physical and virtual spaces, this paper presents an attempt to adjust the space?time prism concept of H\"{a}gerstrand's time geography to identify potential activity opportunities in virtual space, focusing on the virtual space access channels available in physical space. A three?dimensional (3D) spatio?temporal Geographic Information System (GIS) design has been developed in this research to accommodate the adjusted space?time prism concept to support the representation, visualization, and analysis of potential human activities and interactions in physical and virtual spaces using the prism representation.

abstract = {Computing has become increasingly mobile and pervasive, which implies that services must be aware of and adapt to changing contexts in highly dynamic environments. Services that require a lot of user interaction have less potential of being used, because they tend to be obstructive. Thus, context-awareness and adaptation are important research issues in the area of mobile computing. A major goal is to minimize user interaction through service adaptation, and to provide context-sensitive and personalized information to the user. Adaptations for mobile map applications must consider a wide range of factors – from technical requirements to cognitive abilities and goals of the user. However, specifying contextual facts in an accurate and traceable manner is challenging. Initial approaches have focused on information visualization for mobile map applications through context information. These typically focus on simplifying and generalizing route segments rather than adapting to personal information. In this paper we propose a formal conceptual model for automatic mobile map adaptation that can be employed for different applications, such as pedestrian navigation. This model is composed of three components – a context model, a user model, and a task model. Through specified adaptation operations it aims at a reduction of both the user interactionwith the service and the cognitive load for the user.},

abstract = {We define situation awareness (SA) as adaptive, externally directed consciousness. This definition dispels the artificial and contentious division evident in the literature, according to which SA is either exclusively knowledge or exclusively process. This misdirected rivalry has more to do with general perspectives on the study of human behavior than with SA itself. Through defining SA as an aspect of consciousness, we hope to clarify two key issues. (1) The source of goals with respect to SA is a normative arbiter in the task environment; that is, the behavior that SA generates must be directed at an external goal. (2) SA is the invariant at the core of the agent's perception-action cycle that supports skilled performance; that is, relationships among factors or dimensions in the environment determine what the agent must know and do to achieve the goals specified by the external arbiter. We introduce a construct we call the risk space to represent the invariant relations in the environment that enable the agent to adapt to novel situations and to attain prespecified goals. We articulate this concept of a risk space through use of a specific example in commercial aircraft operations. The risk space structures information about the physical airspace in a manner that captures the momentary knowledge that drives action and that satisfies the goals and performance criteria for safe and efficient flight. We note that the risk space may be generalized to many different means of navigation.},

This perspectiverequires a deeper understanding of the ways andmeans people adopt to deal with awarenessinformation as well as considering theintegration of awareness tools with toolssupporting other forms of coordination. First,we suggest to consider two types of awareness:by-product awareness that is generated in thecourse of the activities people must do inorder to accomplish their cooperative tasks;and add-on awareness that is the outcome of anadditional activity, which is a neat cost forthe cooperating actors in relation to what theymust do and is discretional in that it dependson actors' evaluation of the contingentsituation. Secondly, we propose areaction-diffusion metaphor to describe theawareness phenomenology and to take intoaccount the two above-mentioned types ofawareness integration. The model ofawareness derived from the metaphor makesvisible and accessible by different types ofusers a set of elemental primitives whoseflexible composition allows them to constructthe awareness mechanisms they dynamically need. These primitives are incorporated in a softwaremodule that can be used in combination withcoordinative applications for sake of promotingawareness information. The main architectureof the module is presented together with itsinteroperability with the target application;moreover, a simple example illustrates how theincorporated primitives can be used to buildawareness mechanisms.},

Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

We use this to devise a framework for classifying different breakdown–repair scenarios. These scenarios are distinctive in their repair costs and impacts and can be used to highlight the implications of design decisions in collaborativeworksettings. Finally, we show how, via a set of derived guidelines, the results of this analysis were applied to the design of artefacts, including a user interface and computer-generated documents, for a computer-aided image analysis system intended for application in the UK breast screening programme.},

abstract = {Seminal works in the application of design science research (DSR) in IS emphasize the importance of evaluation. However, discussion of evaluation activities and methods is limited and typically assumes an ex post perspective, in which evaluation occurs after the construction of an IS artifact. Such perspectives can assume that the evaluation is an empirical process and its methods can be selected in the same way as empirical research methods. In this paper, we analyze a broader range of evaluation strategies, which includes ex ante (prior to artifact construction) evaluation. This broader view is developed as a strategic DSR evaluation framework, which expands evaluation choices for IS DSR researchers, and also adds emphasis to strategies for evaluating design processes in addition to design products, using well-known quality criteria as an important asset. The framework encompasses both ex ante and ex post orientations as well as naturalistic settings (e.g., case studies) and artificial settings (e.g., lab experiments) for DSR evaluation. The framework proposed offers a strategic view of DSR evaluation that is useful in analyzing published studies, and also in surfacing the evaluation opportunities that present themselves to IS DSR researchers.},

It has been designed to develop new groupware applications and to improve existing ones. This paper presents the features and the structure of BW, and describes two applications that use it.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interdisciplinary interest in designing intelligent human-computer systems for problem-solving. Although progress has been made, we are far from building intelligent human-computer systems that fully exploit the natural synergies of the combination of human and intelligent machine. One of the significant paradigms of intelligent decision support is the cognitive systems engineering approach. This approach considers the human and the intelligent machine as components of a jointcognitive system and focuses on the need to maximize the overall performance of the joint system. Factors influencing the performance of the jointcognitive system include the cognitive characteristics of the human, the computer system, and the task. An important relationship between the cognitive characteristics of the human and those of the system is cognitivecoupling, which has a number of dimensions. The study described in this paper explores the style dimension of cognitivecoupling by presenting a laboratory experiment that examines the interactions among human cognitive style (analytic vs. heuristic), problem type (analysis-inducing vs. heuristic-inducing), and nature of decision aid (analytic vs. heuristic). The study demonstrates that, depending on the characteristics of the human, the computerized aid, and the problem to be solved, the joint human-computer system performance can be better or worse than the performance of the individual human or computer system working alone. Furthermore, the results suggest that the impact of cognitive style on decision-making performance may depend upon the characteristics of the problem, the nature of the decision-aid, and the measures used to evaluate performance. Inadequate recognition of these factors and their interactions may have led to conflicting results in prior decision-making studies using cognitive style.},

abstract = {The concept of distributed situation awareness (DSA) is currently receiving increasing attention from the human factors community. This article investigates DSA in a collaborative real-world industrial setting by discussing the results derived from a recent naturalistic study undertaken within the UK energy distribution domain. The results describe the DSA-related information used by the networks of agents involved in the scenarios analysed, the sharing of this information between the agents and the salience of different information elements used. Thus, the structure, quality and content of each network's DSA is discussed, along with the implications for DSA theory. The findings reinforce the notion that when viewing situation awareness (SA) in collaborative systems, it is useful to focus on the coordinated behaviour of the system itself, rather than on the individual as the unit of analysis and suggest that the findings from such assessments can potentially be used to inform system, procedure and training design. SA is a critical commodity for teams working in industrial systems and systems, procedures and training programmes should be designed to facilitate efficient system SA acquisition and maintenance. This article presents approaches for describing and understanding SA during real-world collaborative tasks, the outputs from which can potentially be used to inform system, training programmes and procedure design.},

abstract = {Computer displays are being designed for increasingly larger industrial systems. As the application domain scales up, maintaining integration across different kinds of views becomes more challenging. This paper presents the results of a study of three different approaches to integration based on the spatial and temporal proximity of related information objects. The domain used for evaluation was a simulation of an industry-scale conventional power plant. All three displays were ecological displays developed using an abstraction hierarchy analysis. Views were integrated in a high-space/low-time, low-space/high-time, and high-space/high-time integration of means-end related objects. During a fault detection and diagnosis task, it as found that a low level of integration, high-space/low-time, provided the fastest fault detection time. However, the most integrated condition, high-space/high-time, resulted in the fastest and most accurate fault diagnosis performance. Actual or potential applications of this research include computer displays for large-scale systems such as network management or process control, for which problem solving is critical and integration must be maintained.},

abstract = {We present a formal-model of awareness-systems founded upon the focus and nimbus model of Benford et al [2] and of Rodden [19]. The model aims to provide a conceptual tool for reasoning about this class of systems. Our model introduces the notions of aspects , attributes and resources in order to expose the communicational aspects of awareness-systems. We show how the model enables reasoning about issues such as deception and plausible deniability, which arguably are crucial for enabling users to protect their privacy and to manage how they present themselves to their social network.},

abstract = {In order to be able to utilise and manage various map specifications for mobile maps, a Map Specification Knowledge Base approach is introduced and formally described. A Map Specification Knowledge Base is a set of specification rules, properties and assignments constituting the system’s knowledge about the map to be delivered to the mobile user. Such knowledge includes rules connecting context parameters with the parameters for the level of details of the map and map generalisation, and settings for the map visualisation. The method uses an object-oriented approach to carry out the multiple-inheritance of the map specification modifiers based on the importance of the rules. The implemented map service can deliver various types of maps, which match the current context parameters and user preferences in real-time. To provide third-party mobile service developers with the possibility to easily create and modify map specifications for their specific needs, a web-based editor, called Map Specification Tool was implemented. The research described here was part of an EU- project referred to as GiMoDig (Geospatial info-mobility service by real-time data-integration and generalisation). A prototype of a cartographic map service was implemented to deliver geospatial data to mobile users in real-time, and is based on emerging standards, such as Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) and Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) specifications.},

@article{Salmon2010,
abstract = {Despite well over two decades of academic research, situation awareness in complex collaborative environments remains ambiguous. Recent systems-based models of distributed situation awareness have attempted to address this; however, further effort is required in clarifying exactly how situation awareness operates in complex socio-technical systems. One pertinent issue regards what the ?distributed? situational picture looks like from the perspective of each component of the system and how it differs amongst team members. Is the same picture ?shared? across team members, or do they have different, but compatible, views on the situation? This article tackles this question by presenting a distributed cognition-inspired systems-based model of situation awareness in collaborative systems, along with an accompanying modelling approach, the propositional network methodology. Following this, the paper focuses explicitly on the model's sub-concept of compatible situation awareness and uses case study evidence to demonstrate how awareness is distributed between, and differs between, team members. This view is then compared to existing team situation awareness views and the implications for collaborative system design are discussed.

abstract = {This paper presents a crisis response simulation model architecture combining a discrete-event simulation (DES) environment for a crisis scenario with an agent-based model of the response organization. In multi-agent systems (MAS) as a computational organization, agents are modeled and implemented separately from the environmental model. We follow this perspective and submit an architecture in which the environment is modeled as a discrete- event simulation, and the crisis response agents are modeled as a multi-agent system. The simultaneous integration and separation of both models allows for independent modifications of the response organization and the scenario, resulting in a testbed that allows testing different organizations to respond to the same scenario or different emergencies for the same organization. It also provides a high-level architecture suggesting the way in which DES and MAS can be combined into a single simulation in a simple way.},
